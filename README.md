# Slate 2

This repository contains early experiments aiming to rebuild the Slate theorem prover
(https://slate-prover.org, https://github.com/SReichelt/slate) on top of a more solid foundation.

For a technical description of what this foundation could look like, see
[DefinitionalUnivalence.pdf](doc/DefinitionalUnivalence/DefinitionalUnivalence.pdf).
